The aim of this assignment is to process and clean the dataset, generate visualizations, and derive insights from the Algerian forest fire dataset by analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI). This analysis will involve utilizing Logistic Regression. Additionally, the assignment will include performing cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to evaluate the model's performance. After developing the model, you will create pickle files and test the model on unseen data.

=======================
Column Descriptions:
=======================
*day: The day of the month (1–31).
*month: The month of the year (1–12).
*year: The year of the record (in this case, all values are 2012).
*Temperature: The temperature (likely in degrees Celsius).
*RH: Relative humidity, representing the percentage of moisture in the air.
*Ws: Wind speed, most likely measured in kilometers per hour (km/h) or meters per second (m/s).
*Rain: Amount of rainfall, likely measured in millimeters (mm).
*FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code): A fire weather index component that measures the moisture content of surface litter and fine fuels. Higher values indicate drier conditions.
*DMC (Duff Moisture Code): This index measures the moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth. It is indicative of drought conditions.
*DC (Drought Code): This index measures moisture content in deep compacted organic layers. It responds to longer-term drought conditions.
*ISI (Initial Spread Index): This is a fire behavior index that estimates the potential for fire spread due to wind and fuel moisture.
*BUI (Build-Up Index): An index that combines DMC and DC values, reflecting the total amount of fuel available for combustion.
*FWI (Fire Weather Index): A comprehensive index used to estimate the potential for wildfire development based on weather conditions.
*Classes: The class label indicating whether a fire occurred. Values are likely "fire" and "not fire".
*Region: This appears to be a numerical label for different regions or areas where the data was collected. Values may represent different geographical locations within the forest dataset.
=========================
Purpose of Each Variable:
=========================
*Day/Month/Year: These provide the time context for the record.
*Weather variables (Temperature, RH, Ws, Rain): These are meteorological factors that can influence fire behavior.
*Fire behavior indices (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI): These are components of the Fire Weather Index (FWI) system, which is commonly used to assess fire danger levels in forested areas. These indices help predict fire ignition potential and fire behavior based on weather conditions.
*Classes: Indicates whether a fire event occurred or not. This would be the target variable in a classification problem to predict fire occurrences.
*Region: Helps distinguish between different regions in the dataset. It could be useful for spatial analysis.

============
Next Steps:
============
Analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI): The key variables are likely FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI, as these relate to fire danger assessment.
It could be drop the "year" column since all the data is from 2012, and it doesn't provide additional useful information.
The region column could be useful to keep in case to be interested in spatial analysis.
